# EmoStream-Concurrent-Emoji-Broadcast-over-Event-Driven-Architecture
Designed and implemented a scalable system to process billions of emoji reactions in real time during live events using Kafka for data streaming and Spark for processing. 
Developed an API endpoint for user inputs, implemented micro-batching for low-latency processing, and created a Pub-Sub model to ensure high concurrency and seamless user interactions.
